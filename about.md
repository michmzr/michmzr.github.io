:wave: Hello World!

My name is Michał Mazur and this is my technical blog or my library with my thoughts, case studies from my career, tutorials etc.
I cover a wide range of topics like productivity, project management, devops, programming, software architecture etc.

I am software engineer with more than 10 years of experience in a wide range of technologies and markets. I was working for small startups to global corporations.
