# What is a work log and how to use it to speed up your career?

As I was diving into "The Software Engineer's Guidebook," by Gergely Orosz I stumbled upon a game-changing tip: keeping a work log.

This practice has been a revelation for me—it's more than just tracking daily tasks. A work log helps you:

✅ Track Your Progress: Stay on top of your projects and see how far you’ve come.

🎉 Celebrate Wins: Big or small, every achievement counts. Documenting them keeps your morale high.

🔄 Learn from Mistakes: Reflect on challenges and turn them into growth opportunities.

💼 Prepare for Promotions: When it’s time to discuss your next career move, having a detailed record of your contributions is invaluable.

Want to start your own work log? I’ve put together a simple template to get you going:

## My weekly template

```md
- What work do I feel most proud of?
- Are there themes in these projects I should be thinking about? What’s the big picture of what I’m working on? (am I working a lot on security? localization?).
- What do I wish I was doing more / less of?
- Which of my projects had the effect I wanted, and which didn’t? Why might that have been?
- What could have gone better with project X? What might I want to do differently next time?
