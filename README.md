:wave: Hello World!

My name is Michał Mazur and this is my technical blog or my library with my thoughts, case studies from my career, tutorials etc.
I cover a wide range of topics like productivity, projekt management, devops, programming, software architecture etc.

I am software engineer with 10 yeard of experience in wide range of technologies and markets. I was working for small startups to global corporations.

At work, I deal with it on a daily basis with:
- Google Cloud Platform
- Kubernetes
- Spring Boot
- BigData
- Java
- Python
- Javascript (from time to time)

I love to learn, jump on the chance to challenge my skills on difficult subjects.
